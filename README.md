# Software-Development-Tools-Project
This project aims to provide with additional practice on common software engineering tasks. These tasks will augment and complement data skills, and make me a more attractive job candidate to potential employers. 

The project is a tool designed to simulate random events using Python programming language. It utilizes various methods and libraries to generate and manage random occurrences according to specified parameters. This tool is versatile and can be applied in various fields such as statistics, gaming, and research where the simulation of random events is essential for analysis and prediction.

Car Advertisement Dashboard

This project is a web application dashboard developed using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly Express. It provides an interactive interface to explore and analyze a dataset of car advertisements.
